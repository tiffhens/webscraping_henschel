		<h2>This Week: Hemp</h2>
			<h4>Why is this miracle plant not being used everywhere? It offers benefits in both the textile and medical industries, and, let's face it, it doesn't even get you high. So why is it illegal? (All the hemp products you buy, FYI, are imported from other countries.) I hope this information enlightens you and leaves you thirsty for more knowledge about this often misunderstood plant.</h4>

		<h3>A Little History</h3>
		<div id="history">
			<p>On April 14, 1937, the Prohibitive Marihuana Tax Law or the bill that outlawed hemp was directly brought to the House Ways and Means Committee. Simply put, this committee is the only one that could introduce a bill to the House floor without it being debated by other committees. At the time, the Chairman of the Ways and Means was Robert Doughton who was a Dupont supporter. With vested interest, he insured that the bill would pass Congress.
</p>
			<p>In an attempt to stop the bill from being passed, Dr. James Woodward, a physician and attorney, attempted to testify on behalf of the American Medical Association. He mentioned that the reason the AMA had not denounced the Marihuana Tax Law sooner was that the Association had just discovered that marihuana was hemp. Or at least a strain of it. Hemp and Marijuana are both varieties of Cannabis sativa, but this distinction was purposely not made well known to the public.&nbsp;Since the law was not so much focused on banning one or the other, both found their way into the ban.&nbsp;The AMA recognized cannabis/marihuana as a medicine found in numerous healing products sold and used for quite some time. The AMA like many other&rsquo;s did not realize that the deadly menace they had been reading about in the media was in fact hemp.
</p>
			<p>In September of 1937, hemp prohibition began. Arguably the most useful plant known to man has become illegal to grow and use both in its non THC strain and THC strain called marihuana. To this day, this plant is still illegal to grow in the United States.

			<h3>Some Facts</h3>
			<div id="textile">
				<h4>Hemp is more efficient, easier to grow, and sturdier than cotton.</h4>
					<p>In a time when consumers are becoming increasingly mindful of the environmental and human impacts of the products they buy, how can cotton possibly remain the fabric of our lives? Accounting for less than 2.5% of cropland worldwide, cotton uses 16% of the world&rsquo;s pesticides. Unsafe use of chemicals severely impacts ecosystems that receive run-off from farms, decreasing animal fertility and freshwater biodiversity.
</p>
					<p>It can take more than 20,000 liters (5,000 gallons) of water to produce 1kg (2 pounds) of cotton, the equivalent of a single T-shirt and pair of jeans. As one of the most &ldquo;thirsty&rdquo; crops, cotton is heavily irrigated and is depleting our limited freshwater sources.
</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, studies show that hemp farming uses considerably less water than its thirsty cotton counterpart. The Stockholm Environment Institute analyzed the UK production of cotton vs. hemp and found that one grow used an estimated 10,000 liters of water to produce 1kg of cotton compared to about 300-500 liters of water to produce 1kg of dry hemp matter, of which 30% is suitable for fiber production.

				<h4>Hemp contains CBD, a cannabinoid</br>with superb medical benefits.</h4>
					<p>CBD is the abbreviation for cannabidiol, the cannabinoid second only to THC when it comes to average volume. Recently, research has shown CBD to have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-anxiety properties without the psychoactive effects (the "high" or "stoned" feeling) that THC provides. While high THC strains often tout levels of over 20%, generally, CBD levels of over 4% are considered to be high.
</p>
					<p>It was initially thought that cannabidiol&rsquo;s main function was to counter the psychoactive effects of THC, but more evidence seems to show that medically, CBD packs quite a punch on its own. It looks to be especially promising for conditions that are difficult to treat such as Crohn&rsquo;s disease, PTSD, and multiple sclerosis. Lately, it is one of the rarest of these conditions, Dravet&rsquo;s Syndrome, that is getting a lot of attention from both the medical community and the public.
</p>
					<p>Dravet&rsquo;s Syndrome is an especially debilitating form of epilepsy that affects children and is notoriously resistant to current approved treatment methods. Sufferers are plagued by seizures, often up to hundreds a day, that worsen as they age and can be life-threatening. Currently, treatment methods include having the child wear an eyepatch, specialized diets, and brain surgery, but all have mixed success rates.
